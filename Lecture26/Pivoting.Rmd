## Overview

* So far we used three different bootstraps:
    * Nonparametric boostrap on the rows (e.g. regression, PCA with random rows and columns)
    * Nonparameteric bootstrap on the residuals (e.g. regression)
    * Parameteric bootstrap (e.g. PCA with fixed rows and columns)
* Today, we will improve the boostrap using pivoting:
    * Studentized bootstrap
    * Bias-corrected bootstrap

## Introduction

* A statistics is (asymptotically) pivotal if its limiting distribution does not depend on unkown quantities
* For example, with observations $X_1,\dots,X_n$ from normal distribution with unkown mean and variance, the pivotal is 
$$g(\theta,X_1,\dots,X_n) = \sqrt{n} \left( \frac{\theta-\hat{\theta}}{\hat{\sigma}} \right)$$
with unbiased estimate for sample mean and variance 
$$\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \hspace{0.5cm} \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\hat{\theta})^2$$
* Then $g(\theta,X_1,\dots,X_n)$ is a pivot following the Student's t-distribution with $\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom
* Because the distribution of $g(\mu,X_1,\dots,X_n)$ does not depend on $\mu$ or $\sigma^2$

## Introduction

* The boostrap is better at estimating the distribution of a pivtotal statistics than at a nonpivotal statistics
* We will see an asymptotic argument using Edgeworth expansions

## Studentized Bootstrap

* 

## Bias-corrected Bootstrap

* 

## Edgeworth Expansions

* Take the pivotal statistics 
$$T = \sqrt{n} (\hat{\theta}-\theta) / \hat{\sigma}$$
with estimate $\hat{\theta}$ asymptotic variance estimate $\hat{\sigma}^2$
* Then, we can use Edgeworth expansions
$$P(S \le x) = \Phi(X) + \sqrt{n} q(x) \phi(x) + O(\sqrt{n})$$
with  
$\Phi$ standard normal distribution,  
$\phi$ standard normal density, and  
$q$ even polynomials of degree 2

## Asymptotic Argument in Favor of Pivoting
