## Overview

* So far we used three different bootstraps:
    * Nonparametric boostrap on the rows (e.g. confidence intervals)
    * Nonparameteric bootstrap on the residuals (e.g. regression)
    * Parameteric bootstrap (e.g. PCA with fixed effects)
* Today, we will have a look at two more:
    * Studentized bootstrap
    * Bias-corrected bootstrap
    * And apply it to observations that lie on a manifold  
    (although a simple one: the circle)
