### Final Project Contents

1. A theoretical part: explanation of the method studied, its properties.
2. A computational part: an algorithm for implementing the method in matlab or S-plus, this should also be emailed to the TAs so it can be tested. Make sure your code is readable, so we can eventually do a little trouble shooting if necessary.
3. A data-analysis part: actual data are to be submitted to the method studied, or tables should show comparisons, or theoretical results should be outlined.

Analysis of a data set with your algorithm: Perform a statistical analysis of some data set from an experiment, survey, or secondary data source using R. You should pay critical attention to issues concerning how the data were collected as well as to the statistical analysis. (Depending on the nature of the data and your own relationship to it, you may want to give more or less emphasis to explanation of the data collection.) You should make sure that your data set has enough complexity (more than just a couple of variables, and a decent number of observations) to support an interesting analysis.

Computer output should be incorporated in the usual way, i.e. put tables in the text or at the end but do not hand in a pile of unedited computer output. Tables and figures should be numbered and captioned. No uncommented output will be considered. The quality of presentation will come into account for the final grade. (Incorporation of good quality graphics, careful text-processing, no superfluous output). You should put the text of your computer programs in an appendix.
