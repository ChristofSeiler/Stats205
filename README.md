# Introduction to Nonparametric Statistics

## Description
Nonparametric analogs of the one- and two-sample t-tests and analysis of variance; the sign test, median test, Wilcoxon's tests, and the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests, tests of independence. Nonparametric regression and nonparametric density estimation, modern nonparametric techniques, nonparametric confidence interval estimates.
