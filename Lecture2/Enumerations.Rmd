## Law School Data

Correlation coefficient for the law school data from the boostrap package.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(bootstrap)

data(law)
law
```

We plot it using ggplot2. If you don't know this package yet, take a look, it's very powerful to visualize all kinds of things.

```{r}
law2 = data.frame(Observation = 1:dim(law)[1],law)
ggplot(law2, aes(x = LSAT, y = GPA)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = Observation),hjust = 0,vjust = 0)
```

## Complete Enumeration

Take a close look and you will see the corner around 0.9. This corner doens't who up when using Monte Carlo simulations. If you take out observation 1 this corner disappears.
