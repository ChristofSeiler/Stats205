## When Is Something Nonparametric?

1. Distribution-free (NOT assumption-free)
* Sample $X_1,\dots,X_n$ from $F$
* Statistic $T(X_1,\dots,X_n)$
* $T$ is distribution-free if 
* $T$ has **same distribution** for any $F$ with some restrictions specific to the test, for example:
* Sign test: $F$ any continuous distribution
* Signed-Rank test: $F$ any symmetric continuous distribution

## When Is Something Nonparametric?

* When the right representation of the "center" is the median
* Very small sample size
* With ordinal data and ranked data
* Data with outliers that cannot easily be removed
* In all other cases use parametric test becaue they are more powerful

## When to Use Nonparametic Tests?

2. Nonparametric models (number of parameters can grow with $n \to \infty$)
    * Nonparametric regression
    * Bayesian nonparametric
    * Wavelets
    * Graphons

## When to Use Nonparametric Models?

* Very sample size is large
* Low dimensional setting otherwise course of dimensionality
* Complex relationship between predictor and response

## Regression Fits in Both Categories

* Rank-Based linear regression (distribution-free)
* Nonlinear regression (nonparametric model)

## Learning Goals

1. The students will learn to apply methods and explain the statistical assumptions of **Monte Carlo simulations** for analytically intractable problems.

* We used Monte Carlo in most topics
    * permutation tests
    * bootstrap
    * rank-based
* As an alternative to asymptotics and exhaustive tests

## Learning Goals

2. The students will learn to apply methods and explain the statistical assumptions of **rank-based methods** for parameter estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

## Bootstrap vs. Permutation Tests

* Permutations test hypotheses concerning distributions; bootstraps test hypotheses concerning parameters. As a result, the bootstrap entails less-stringent assumptions.
* Bootstrap tests are not exact
* Permutation tests are exact
-->

## Learning Goals (Advanced)

5. The students will build-up an **advanced toolbox of methods** that they can use in practical data analysis problems. Tools include: Nonlinear regression, Bayesian nonparametrics, and wavelets.
6. The students will learn to apply various **data visualization tools for data exploration in nonparametric settings**, such as: association plots, mosaic plots, correspondence analysis, median polish, and Tukey additivity plot.

## Bootstrap

* STATS 208: Introduction to the Bootstrap
    * The bootstrap is a computer-based method for assigning measures of accuracy to statistical estimates. By substituting computation in place of mathematical formulas, it permits the statistical analysis of complicated estimators. Topics: nonparametric assessment of standard errors, biases, and confidence intervals; related resampling methods including the jackknife, cross-validation, and permutation tests. Theory and applications. Prerequisite: course in statistics or probability.

## Wavelets

* STATS 322: Function Estimation in White Noise
    * Gaussian white noise model sequence space form. Hyperrectangles, quadratic convexity, and Pinsker's theorem. Minimax estimation on Lp balls and Besov spaces. Role of wavelets and unconditional bases. Linear and threshold estimators. Oracle inequalities. Optimal recovery and universal thresholding. Stein's unbiased risk estimator and threshold choice. Complexity penalized model selection. Connecting fast wavelet algorithms and theory. Beyond orthogonal bases.

## Hypothesis Testing

* STATS 300C: Theory of Statistics
    * The main goal of this course is to expose students to modern ideas in statistical theory. Whereas classical theory is concerned with the behavior of statistical estimates when the number of variables is fixed and the sample size increases, our emphasis is on statistical inference in high-dimensional settings where there may be as many, or more, variables than observations. Our focus is motivated by always newer technologies, which now produce extremely large datasets, often with huge numbers of measurements on each of a comparatively small number of experimental units.

## Correspondence Analysis

* STATS 306A: Discrete Data Analysis (Art Owen) but listed as
* STATS 306A: Methods for Applied Statistics
    * Regression modeling extended to categorical data. Logistic regression. Loglinear models. Generalized linear models. Discriminant analysis. Categorical data models from information retrieval and Internet modeling. Prerequisite: 305 or equivalent.

## Bayesian Nonparametrics

* STATS 270: Bayesian Statistics I (STATS 370)
    * This is the first of a two course sequence on modern Bayesian statistics. Topics covered include: real world examples of large scale Bayesian analysis; basic tools (models, conjugate priors and their mixtures); Bayesian estimates, tests and credible intervals; foundations (axioms, exchangeability, likelihood principle); Bayesian computations (Gibbs sampler, data augmentation, etc.); prior specification. Prerequisites: statistics and probability at the level of Stats300A, Stats305, and Stats310.

## Bayesian Nonparametrics

* STATS 271: Bayesian Statistics II (STATS 371)
    * This is the second of a two course sequence on modern Bayesian statistics. Topics covered include: Asymptotic properties of Bayesian procedures and consistency (Doobs theorem, frequentists consistency, counter examples); connections between Bayesian methods and classical methods (the complete class theorem); generalization of exchangeability; general versions of the Bayes theorem in the undominated case; non parametric Bayesian methods (Dirichelet and Polya tree priors). Throughout general theory will be illustrated with classical examples. Prerequisites: Stats 270/370.

## ANOVA

    * The course introduces basic concepts, theoretical basis and statistical methods associated with survival data. Topics include censoring, Kaplan-Meier estimation, logrank test, proportional hazards regression, accelerated failure time model, multivariate failure time analysis and competing risks. The traditional counting process/martingale methods as well as modern empirical process methods will be covered. Prerequisite: Understanding of basic probability theory and statistical inference methods.
* STATS 215: Statistical Models in Biology
    * Poisson and renewal processes, Markov chains in discrete and continuous time, branching processes, diffusion. Applications to models of nucleotide evolution, recombination, the Wright-Fisher process, coalescence, genetic mapping, sequence analysis. Theoretical material approximately the same as in STATS 217, but emphasis is on examples drawn from applications in biology, especially genetics. Prerequisite: 116 or equivalent.

    * Experiments vs observation. Confounding. Randomization. ANOVA.Blocking. Latin squares. Factorials and fractional factorials. Split plot. Response surfaces. Mixture designs. Optimal design. Central composite. Box-Behnken. Taguchi methods. Computer experiments and space filling designs. Prerequisites: probability at STATS 116 level or higher, and at least one course in linear models.

## Graphons

* STATS 300: Advanced Topics in Statistics: Stochastic Block Models and Latent Variable Models
    * Main topic: statistical inference of latent variable models (including SBM), using EM-like algorithms. The critical step is the determination of the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed data, which is doable for mixture models and hidden Markov models. For more complex models such as the stochastic block model (SBM: popular in sociology, physics, biology, etc.) variational approximations can be used to derive a generalized version of EM algorithm. This approach can be extended to Bayesian inference (variational Bayes EM algorithm). If time permits, change-point detection models will be introduced. Topics will be illustrated with examples from genomics.

## Background

* PHIL 166: Probability: Ten Great Ideas About Chance (PHIL 266, STATS 167, STATS 267)
    * Foundational approaches to thinking about chance in matters such as gambling, the law, and everyday affairs. Topics include: chance and decisions; the mathematics of chance; frequencies, symmetry, and chance; Bayes great idea; chance and psychology; misuses of chance; and harnessing chance. Emphasis is on the philosophical underpinnings and problems. Prerequisite: exposure to probability or a first course in statistics at the level of STATS 60 or 116.
