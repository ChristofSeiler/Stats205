## Introduction

* We saw many rank-based hypothesis tests for univariate observations
* There are generalizing to the mulitvariate case
* Today, we will cover:
    * Friedman and Rafsky test
    * Tukey depth
    * Mantel test

## Wald-Wolfowitz Runs Test

* Is another univariate tests
* Example: Hot hand in basketball

## Friedman and Rafsky Test

* Generalization of Wald-Wolfowitz runs test to higher dimensions
* Uses minimal spanning trees

## Minimal Spanning Trees

TODO

## Tukey Depth

* It is based on **depth functions**
* One example is the Tukey depth

## Mantel Test

* Test for multivariate assocations
* Or associations between matrices
