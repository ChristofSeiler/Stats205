## Modern Statistics

To quote Andrew Gelman [(source)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2968.pdf):

```
          "If you wanted to do foundational research 
          in statistics in the mid-twentieth century, 
          you had to be bit of a mathematician, 
          ... if you want to do statistical research 
          at the turn of the twenty-first century, 
          you have to be a computer programmer."
```

## History of Nonparametric Statistics

Check on Google Ngram Viewer.

```{r warning = FALSE,echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ngramr)
ng  <- ngram(c("nonparametrics statistics"), year_start = 1950)
ggplot(ng, aes(x=Year, y=Frequency, colour=Phrase)) + geom_line()
```
