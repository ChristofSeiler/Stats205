## Exercise 1

Write R code to draw 100 sample curves from the Dirichlet Process (DP) prior for different concentration parameter $\alpha$ and one fixed base distribution $F$ (for example the normal distribution). What happens when you change $\alpha$? What does this corresponds to in more standard dstribution, say the normal distribution?

## Exercise 2

From our textbook (Ex. 4.9.19) [(Stanford library link)](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10718635):  

Exercise about a two-way table, and redo with median polish. Are there any differences? What is the median polish robust to?

## Exercise 3

From our textbook (Ex. 4.9.20) [(Stanford library link)](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10718635):
