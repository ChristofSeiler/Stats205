# Teaching Workshop at Stanford

## Day 1 (Dec. 3, 2015)

* Who was a good teacher in your life? 
* Usually hard to say why: They care about the topic or they care about you?

### Learning Climate Video

* Motivate why we have to learn certain things
* Tell personal stories/experiences (e.g. when I was a first year medical student, I didn't know why we had to learn this neuroscience stuff)
