## Introduction

* We consider very large graphs (number of nodes $n \to \infty$)
* Modeling graphs using functions (graph limits)
* Statistical estimation of graph limits
* Parametric approximation with stochastic blockmodels

## Random Graphs

TODO: Lovasz (2012), p. 8, Section 1.4

## Generative Model

TODO: Chatterjee (2015), p. 14, section 2.6

* A graph limit or graphon is a measurable function $f$ from $[0,1]^2$ into $[0,1]$ that satisfies $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$ for all $x$ and $y$
* We can use graphons to generate random graphs
* Consider $U_1,\dots,U_n$ iid uniform random variables between 0 and 1
* Putting an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ with probability $f(U_i,U_j)$
* Do this independently for all $1 \le i < j \le n$

## Statistical Estimation

TODO: Chatterjee (2015), p. 14, section 2.6

* Given such a model, the statistical question that we can ask is
* Is it possible to estimate the graphon from a single realization of the graph?
* In other words, is it possible to estimate the numbers 
$$f(U_i,U_j), \hspace{0.5cm} 1 \le i < j \le n$$
* Written in matrix with $(i,j)$th elements that are given by $f(U_i,U_j)$

## Statistical Estimation

TODO: Chatterjee (2015)

* Use the Matrix Estimation by Universal Singular Value Thresholding by Chaterjee
* Mention the other two papers as well

## Bayesian Estimation

Caron? (bipartite graphs)

Robin? (variational inference for stochastic blockmodels)
