## The Lady and the Tea

* Fisher starts his second chapter in his famous book on "The Design of Experiments" first published in 1935:
* Quote: ``A lady declares that by tasting a cup of tea made with milk she can discriminate whether the milk or the tea infusion was first added to the cup.``
* Fisher proposed the the following experiment to test this
* Prepare eight cups of tea
* In four, add tea first
* In the other four, add milk first
* Hold constant other features of the cups of tea (size, temperature, etc.)
* Present cups in random order
* Lady tasts them and judges
* She knows that there are four of each type

## The Lady and the Tea

* Our theory is that the lady can taste the difference
* Which translates into our null hypothesis:  
$H_0:$ lady **cannot** taste difference
* The test statistics is the number of correct judgements
* Under the null all judgments are equally likely
* What is the null distribution of correct judgments?
* Once we have that compare it to the experiment and compute the probability of having observed the experimantal outcome or a more extreme case

## The Lady and the Tea

* Because of randomization, all $8! = 40320$ permutations of the cups are equally likely, and each one has its own number of correct judgements
* There are ${8 \choose 4} = 70$ ways of choosing 4 cups from 8 cups
* Think of it as, choosing 4 cups in succession by first choosing from 8 cups, then 7, 6, 5, which gives $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 1680$
* But by doing so, we have chosen not only every possible set of 4, but every possible set in every possible order
* Since 4 cups can be rearranged in order in $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$, we correct by $1680/24 = 70$

## The Lady and the Tea

```{r}
truth =     c("tea","milk","milk","milk","tea","tea","tea","milk")
judgement = c("tea","milk","milk","milk","tea","tea","milk","tea")
t(data.frame(truth = truth,judgement = judgement))
```

* Under the null, the reasons for the lady's judgements are unkown, except that they have nothing to do with the truth
* The judgements are what they are; they are fixed
* All $70$ ways to line up cups are equally likely
* But only one line up will match the lady's judgements

## The Lady and the Tea

Of the four cups where the tea was poured first, select $t$ of them to say "tea" correctly, and $4âˆ’t$ to say "milk" incorrectly

```{r echo=TRUE}
t = 0:4
probability = (choose(4,t)*choose(4,4-t))/choose(8,4)
data.frame(t=t,probability=round(probability,digits=3))
```

* The chances of a match is $\frac{1}{70} = 0.014 < 0.05$
* We need perfect match!

## The Lady and the Tea

Monte Carlo simulations

```{r echo=TRUE}
judgement = c("tea","milk","milk","milk","tea","tea","milk","tea")
nSim = 10000
permutations = replicate(nSim,sample(8,replace = FALSE))
matches = apply(permutations,2,function(i) sum(judgement[i] == judgement))
data.frame(t=t,
           probability=round(probability,digits=3),
           monte=round(table(matches)/nSim,digits=3))
```

## The Lady and the Tea

```{r echo=TRUE}
t = 0:7
probability = (choose(7,t)*choose(7,7-t))/choose(14,7)
data.frame(t=t,probability=round(probability,digits=4))
```

* If she tasted 14 cups, it would be possible to reject $H_0$ without requiring perfect judgement
* We need either perfect match or one miss to get a $p$-value below $0.05$

## Darwin and Fisher

* In chapter 3 of Fisher's book, he then introduced the first nonparametric test
* He illustrated his approach on data from Darwin
* Darwin raised cross- and self-fertilized corn (Zea mays) plants
* He planted equal numbers of each in four different pots, but not same number in each pot
* Darwin measured heights of plants when they were between 12 and 24 inches in height

## Darwin and Fisher

Original data (plant height in inches) from Darwin listed in Fisher's book

```{r }
data("ZeaMays")
ZeaMays
```

## Darwin and Fisher {.build}

Fisher proceeds by testing the hypothesis  
$H_0:$ No difference between crossed and self-fertilized plants

He peforms the paired sample $t$-test 
```{r}
t.test(ZeaMays$cross,ZeaMays$self,paired = TRUE,alternative = "two.sided")
```

## Darwin and Fisher

```{r echo=TRUE}
ZeaMays$diff
```
* Then he invents the first permutation test
* Under $H_0$ that self-fertilized versus cross-fertilized does not matter, only chance determined whether $A-B$ or $B-A$
* So the absolute value of the difference is what it is, but the plus or minus sign is by chance alone
* Test statistic is sum of the differences
* There are $2^{15} = 32768$ ways to swap the plus and minus signs, all equaly likely under $H_0$
* Calculate statistic for each one to get null distribution

## Darwin and Fisher

* Random samples $X_1,\dots,X_n$ from $X$
* Test $H_0: E(X) = 0$
* Write the usuall statistic as
$$T = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \sum_{i=1}^n |X_i| \delta_i$$
* and split samples into two parts
$$(|X_1|,\dots,|X_n|) \hspace{1cm}\text{and}\hspace{1cm} (\delta_1,\dots,\delta_n)$$
* Under $H_0$ the two parts are independent and $\delta_i$ is a fair coin flip $\{-1,1\}$
* The distribution of $T$ is not well defined under $H_0$

## Darwin and Fisher

* But if we fix $|X_i|$ at their observed values and regard $\delta_i$ as random
* Then the condition null of $T$ is well defined
* The only thing left to do is to compute
$$P\left(T \ge t \, \big| \, H_0, |X_1|, \dots, |X_n| \right)$$
by listing all possible samples of type
$$\left(\pm \, |X_1|, \dots, \pm \, |X_n|\right)$$
* This is usually called the *Fisher's randomization test*
* Permutation tests describe a special case of randomization
* In permutation tests, we permute group labels on the observations

## Darwin and Fisher

Using Monte Carlo simulations
```{r echo=TRUE}
nSim = 10000
n = length(ZeaMays$diff)
absDiff = abs(ZeaMays$diff)
signs = matrix(replicate(nSim*n,sample(c(-1,1),size=1)),nrow = nSim)
TNull = apply(signs,1,function(row) sum(row * absDiff))
T0 = sum(ZeaMays$diff)
pvalue = 2*mean(TNull >= T0); pvalue
```

## Darwin and Fisher

```{r}
df = data.frame(TNull=TNull)
ggplot(df, aes(TNull)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = T0,colour = "red",size = 1.5) +
  ggtitle("Randomization Distribution for Darwin's Zea Data")
```

## Darwin and Fisher

* We already looked at similar tests
* The *sign test*: 
    * Test statistic: $S = \#_i \{ X_i \}$
    * Wilcoxon signed-rank test: $W = \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{R}(|X_i|) \delta_i$
* In contrast to the randomization test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is not conditional on the ranks

## Permutation Test -- General Recipe

* Decide on a test statistic $T$
* List the possible values of $T$
* Under $H_0$, all ways of re-arranging the data are equally likely
* $P(T = t)$ is proportional to the number of ways of getting the value $t$
* The permutation $p$-value is the probability of getting a value of $T$ as extreme or more extreme as the value we observed, "extreme" meaning in a direction inconsistent with $H_0$

## Permutation Test -- One-Sample Problem

* Location model: $X_i = \theta + e_i$
* Assume error distribution has symmetric pdf $f(t)$ around $\theta$
* Hypothesis test: $H_0: \theta = 0$ versus $H_A: \theta > 0$
* Test statistic: Sum of deviations of $\theta$ about $0$
* Under null, positive and negative deviations cancel each other out, so sum should be close to zero
* We reject the null in favor of alternative if sum is "large"
* To find what large means we comaper to null distribution using permutation
* What to permute?
* We use principle of *sufficiency*

## Permutation Test -- One-Sample Problem

* Assume that we had lost the signs information
* Under the null, we can recover the orginal distribution by randomly assigning signs to each deviation
* In this case, we say that the deviations are sufficient
* Under the alternative of a location parameter larger than zero, randomizing the signs of the deviations should reduce the sum from what it was originally
* List all possible reassignments of plus and minus signs $2^n$
* Compare observed sum with all possible sums

## Permutation Test -- Two-Sample Problem

* Test statistic: Sum of observations from second population
* Assume that we had lost the group assignments
* Under the null, we can recover the original distribution by randomly assigning groups to each observation
* In this case, we say that the observations (without group labels) are sufficient
* Under the alternative one group will have a larger sum
* List all possible group reassignments and compute sum of second population
* Compare observed sum to all possible sums

## Assumption: Exchangeable Observations

* A sufficient condition for permutation test is exchangeable of observations
* Consider a collection of random variables 
$$ X_1,\dots,X_n $$
* If their joint distribution are equal under permuations $\pi$
$$P_{X_1,\dots,X_n}(A) = P_{X_{\pi(1)},\dots,X_{\pi(n)}}(A)$$ 
* then $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are called exchangable 
* This is a weaker assumption than indepdendence of observations in the combined sample

## Assumption: Exchangeable Observations

* Some examples:
* Independent and identically distributed observations are exchangeable
* Samples without replacement from a finite population are exchangeable:
    * An urn contains $b$ black balls, $r$ red balls, $y$ yellow balls, and so forth
    * A series of balls are extracted from the urn 
    * After the $i$th extraction, the color of the ball $X_i$ is noted and $k$ balls of the same color are added to the urn, 
    * where $k$ can be any integer, positive, negative, or zero
    * The set of random events $\{X_i\}$ form an exchangeable sequence
* Dependent normally distributed random variables $\{X_i\}$ for which the variance of $X_i$ is a constant independent of $i$ and the covariance of $X_i$ and $X_j$ is a constant independent of $i$ and $j$

## Assumption: Exchangeable Observations

* Sometimes a simple transformation will ensure that observations are exchangeable
* For example, if we know that $X$ comes from a population with mean $\mu$ and distribution $F(xâˆ’\mu)$ and 
* an independent observation $Y$ comes from a population with mean $v$ and distribution $F(xâˆ’v)$
* then the independent variables $X'=Xâˆ’\mu$ and $Y'=Yâˆ’v$ are exchangeable

## How to Compute It?

* Small sample size:  
Enumerations of all permutations using Gray codes  
(takes expotional time in $n$)
* Medium sample size:  
Fast Frourier Transform  
(takes polynomial time in $n$)
* Large sample size:  
Monte Carlo simulations   
(time depends on accuracy requirements)
