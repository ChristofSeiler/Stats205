## Introduction

* Exploratory data anlaysis is usually not parametric
* For instance, in Principle Component Analysis (PCA), we do not assume any parametric model (the data doesn't need to be normally distributed)
* What is described by PCA is a decomposition of the data in Principle Components (PC) along with the variance is maximized after projecting the data onto the PC
* As we have seen in this class, it is in general not necessary to assume a parameteric model for inference

## Introduction

* We sucessfully used ranks that allowed to remove the normality assumptions in one and two-sample tests
* We sucessfully used the bootstrap to sample from the empirical distribution and construct confidence intervals
* We sucessfully used permutation tests for hypothesis testing
* In all these examples we have found ways to make inference even without even a completely defined underlying model
* Is this possible for data visualization?
* That'ts the topic for today
