## Introduction

* Keys to any statistical inference most commonly is random sample from the popuation in question
* Goal is to get the best possible representation of the population of the quantifiy of interest
* How to collect sample data?
* Are there alternative to a random sample?
* Usually, once the sample items hae been chosen, the desired measurements are collected from each of the selecte items
* **Ranked set sampling**: It is not a sampling technique; it is a data measurement tequniques

## Introduction

* First introduced in McIntyre in 1952 for situations where
    * actual measurements for on sample observations is expensive
    * ranking observations is cheap
    * collecting sample units is cheap and reliable
* Example: Bone mineral density in a human population
    * Subjects for such a study are plentiful
    * Measurements of BMD via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on selected subject is expensive
    * Because we need medical experts (e.g. orthopedic surgeons or anatomist) to manually segment images
    * Thus it is important to minimize the number of subjects required for the study without sacrificing information about the BMD makeup of the population

## Introduction

* Consider random sample $X_1,\dots,X_n$
* Additionally to simple random sampling, there is stratified sampling, proportional sampling, and concomitant variable based sampling
* These are different kinds of sampling techniques define **prior** to data collection
* Ranked set sampling is a techniques **during** data collection
* It helps to direct attention toward measuremnts of more representative units
* As a result, we get measurements that are more likely to span the range of values in the population

## Collecting a Ranked Set Sample

* To obtain $k$ observations from a population
* First, use simple random sampling to select $k$ units from a population
* Then, rank order them according to a predefined attribute
* A variety of mechanisms are: 
    * Visual comparison
    * Expert opinion
    * Auxiliary variabele
    * Cannot involve your quantitiy of interest!
* The unit that is judged the smallest is included in your ranked set sample
* This first unit is called the **first judgement order statistics** and denoted by $X_{[1]}$
* Square brackets are used because this may not coincide with true order statistics usually denoted by $X_{(1)}$

## Collecting a Ranked Set Sample

* The remaining $k-1$ units are not considered further (their role was only to assist selecting the smallest ranked unit)
* Then we repeat the same procedure to select the second $X_{[2]}$ by picking the second smallest judgement order statistic
* And continue this procedure until $X_{[k]}$
* One such run sequcence $X_{[1]},\dots,X_{[k]}$ is called a **cycle**
* This is called a **balanced** ranked set sample since we collect one unit for each ranks
* To obtain $n = k\times m$ observation we repeat the entire process
$$
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline 
Cycle $1$ & $X_{{[1]1}}$ & $\dots$ & $X_{{[k]1}}$ \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
Cycle $m$ & $X_{{[1]m}}$ & $\dots$ & $X_{{[k]m}}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
$$

## Collecting a Ranked Set Sample (Example)

* Unburned hydrocarbons emitted from automobile tailpipes and via evaporation are among the primary contributions to ozone and smog in large cities
* One way to reduce polution is to use reformulated gasoline, designed to reduce volatility measured through Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) value
* To enforce this regular gasoline samples are taken from pumps at stations and RVP is measured
* There is crude field measure and a more refined lab measure
* The goal is to use the cruder and cheaper measure as a surragate for the more expansive lab measure in order to reduce the actual amount of lab measures
